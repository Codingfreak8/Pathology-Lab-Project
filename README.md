# Pathology-Lab-Project
This is the school project that I made.
In this project i have a prototype of a software in which user can enter the information of customers who come to have a medical test for Diabetes and malaria.
The user can then store the details of the customers and then proide a unique id and the time after which they can collect their report.
The project also provides the report .
It also includes the facility for the user(admin) to see the reports of all the patients and also provides the stat of the patients.


I have attached the source code as well as the word file of the project.
Also i have included a word file of the screenshots of the project for refernce purposes.
There are four text files that are required for the project.
