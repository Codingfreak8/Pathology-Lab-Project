 1. THICK AND THIN BLOOD SMEARS==>  
                 Diagnosis of malaria involves performing blood smears.These 
                 tests are currently the "gold standard" for malaria detection
                 and identification.

 2. RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST==> 
                 These tests detect malaria antigens in a sample of a person's
                 blood and indicate a psitive result by a colour change on the 
                 testing strip.

 3. MOLECULAR TESTS==>  
                 This test can  also be used to confirm the diagnosis in 
                 laboratories. It is used to determine the plasmodium species
                 in the blood sample.
